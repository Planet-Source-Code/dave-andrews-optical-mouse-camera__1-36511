### Description

Use your optical mouse as a camera! Very easy to use, and code is quite simple. Provides greyscale, lowquality, out of focus images, but it's lots of fun. Send it to a friend! It's not a PSC code of the month, but if you want to vote to voice your opinion, go ahead. Please do not look directly into your mouse LED!
